# Fullstackeletro (Version React Native)



### Introduction

<p>
FullStackEletro is a website developed on the support and guidance of Recode Pro. It is an e-commerce of home appliances in which it starts with classic versions
of development such as HTML, CSS and JS ... as the Recode Pro course evolves, the project undergoes refactorings. This version was developed in React Native.

## Interactivity
<p>
   The user's actions have animations, for example: when the password is wrong, the Protoman is waiting and when the password is set, the Mega Man is running. This replaces warnings. Of course, this involves a lot of audience issues. As it is an open project, I chose to create something credible and lively.
